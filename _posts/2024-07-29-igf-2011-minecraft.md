## Revisiting IGF Grand Prize Winner 2011: Minecraft

Watching [the recording of the 2011 IGF Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3_aun7BqbY) is strange. I mean, of course it's strange -- it's 50 minutes of game developers attempting public speaking, but watching it now, in the shadow of what Minecraft has become, it's truly a relic of the past. Andy Schatz, the winner of the previous year's grand prize, introduces this year's winner by saying, "When you're indie for long enough, you learn to become myopic. You learn to make little things. Selling one unit is thrilling.  ... The IGF is not intended to make a small thing big, though. The IGF is our moment to remind the world that there is beauty hidden in the shadow of the big cars, the big houses, the big livestock, and the big games." His metaphor is a little strange (livestock?), and I might have misinterpreted it the first time I heard it, but now I think I get what he meant. In that moment, Minecraft was starting to get larger than life, and the cash was rolling in for the developers, Mojang Studios. I imagine Schatz was considering the future of indie games, and if that future looked like Minecraft: digitally distributed, well-designed, wildly profitable. Schatz seems a bit conflicted giving the award; from the "though" in "The IGF is not intended to make a small game big, though", I would even say that he had an idea of what Minecraft was to become: the preinstalled on Windows Minecraft, the Target T-shirt Minecraft, the TikTok storytime Minecraft, the ported to Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, iOS, 3DS, WiiU, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita Minecraft, the "Story Mode", "Dungeons", and "Legends" Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time Minecraft. 

Of course, since that moment in 2011, a hell of a lot has happened to the game. At the end of 2011, the game left beta with the official 1.0 release. Around the same time, Jens Bergensten [took over as lead programmer] and the original designer, Markus "Notch" Persson took a step back(https://web.archive.org/web/20111227053605/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/13633493969/och-med-dom-orden-sa-passar-jag-micken). Online video content about the game exploded. Sales kept coming in. They started a [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecon). Most importantly, in 2014, the owners of Mojang, Persson, Carl Manneh, and Jakob Porser sold Mojang to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. In these few short years, Minecraft had gone from an indie game to a phenomenon to a corporate franchise, and Notch had gone from a game developer to an idle billionaire. 

From that point we get two stories. One of Microsoft taking the game and marketing it like crazy, while the developers added more blocks, mobs, and functionalities to the game. Spinoffs were made, too; Telltale made a [Telltale-like game](https://www.telltale.com/minecraft-story-mode/) and a sequel, while Mojang made a [Diablo-like](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-dungeons) and [Minecraft Legends](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-legends), which to be honest, I can't even tell what kind of game it is. Jens Bergensten [still works for Mojang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jens-bergensten-9b04241/?originalSubdomain=se) and people are still really into Minecraft.

On the other hand, the owners, specifically Persson and Porser, started a new company, Rubberbrain, which didn't do much but [leak money](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/spela/a/B35Gev/minecraft-grundarnas-nota-for-nya-studion-60-miljoner-kronor) until rebranding as Bitshift Entertainment this year. As of this year, Persson is promising a new game -- a "roguelike (in the old sense: cursed items, ridiculously broken mechanics, and so on) combined with a first-person dungeon crawler" called [Levers and Chests](https://twitter.com/notch/status/1775347747933344195). It's far too early to say anything about it, but given the man's track record after becoming a billionaire, I wouldn't be surprised if it never comes out. Before playing ["Drowning in Problems"](http://game.notch.net/drowning/#), the only game Persson has put out since Microsoft acquired Mojang, I thought it would be an interesting talking point, but it really is pretty boring. It's an idle game that turns the experience of life to pure statistics, and those statistics don't make much sense either. It's mindless faux-self-reflection. There's lots to be read about the man and his absurd [wealth](https://www.forbes.com/profile/markus-persson/) and his [wack opinions](https://twitter.com/notch/status/901192994971410433), but really, it's not worth talking about.

Because of all that, watching the 2011 IGF Awards, it was strange to once again regard Minecraft as this genius game that came out of nowhere. Really though, it shouldn't have been, because I was playing Minecraft in 2011. I remember the freshness of the game, and the passionate early community it had. I must have been 11 or 12, because I purchased the game while it was still in beta. I played it mostly by myself, since my friends hadn't caught on yet, and I didn't understand how to set up a server in the slightest. I stuck to Survival mode, adventuring and building a castle for myself. When looking to revisit the game, I couldn't figure out how to download the beta versions, but [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/) allowed me to play version 1.0. Although there was some stuff I didn't recall, like experience points (what do they even do?), the few hours I spent in Survival mode was just as compelling as it was when I was a kid. 

The game just gets it. It understands the balance between designer-made and player-made goals. It understands how to make the world feel tactile. It understands what should and shouldn't be procedurally generated. It understands how to make the player feel calm in one moment and dread in the next. I scrubbed the images of 8-year-olds in creeper zip hoodies and the sound of the TikTok text-to-speech lady from my brain and built myself a little house in a shallow cave. I went out to gather resources. I came back and gave it a skylight so that I could watch the moon while smelting iron ore. While planting roses around the glass a creeper blew my shit up. I patched the hole and decided to change the layout of the house while I was at it. It's a life-affirming game to play -- and that's only the surface. People have made absolutely crazy shit within the games systems, both architectural wonders and feats of redstone engineering. It's as enthralling to play on one's own as it is with friends, and its procedural generated worlds plus its never-ending hunt for resources provide the player with wordless emergent narratives. Minecraft, at the end of the day, even if the designer is a prick with too much money and nothing nice to say, is a game that deserves to be as huge as it is.
